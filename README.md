# Kustomer Banking App

This application was created with the following:
* NodeJS
* ReactJS
* React Router v4
* Redux
* Webpack 2
* Sass
* Babel
* Jest

## Starting the Application
1. git clone the repository
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm start`
3. Visit the application at `http://localhost:3000/`


## Testing the application
I used the Jest framework to write tests for the application. There are tests for the reducer, action creators, and snapshot tests for the components. Tests are run by running the `npm test` command. You can also run the test in watcher mode by running `npm run test:watch`.

## Self Evaluation
Overall, I can only say I'm fairly satisfied with my performance on this task. I was, however, excited to use Webpack 2 and react router v4 for the first time and I love the improvements that have been made to each. I would have liked to spend more time on improving the UI and spent more time cleaning up the code. Here are some other things I would add to the roadmap:
* Error handling
* Improve build times
* Set up a production and dev build
* Set up a login system and user profile
